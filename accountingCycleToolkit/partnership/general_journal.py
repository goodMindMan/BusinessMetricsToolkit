# WHAT  IS JOURNALING???
# Journaling is tha first step in the accounting cycle
# To perform a transaction (and report it in the General Journal i.e. `Journaling.general_journal`)-
# the user or essentially accountants provide the date of the transactions- 
# , the acccounts affected by the transactions ,and the amount that the accounts are affected by
# In the case of this program it also provides random five digit IDs for each transaction-->(henceforth interchangably: entry, journal entry, record)

# READ THIS!!
# In a normal accounting cycle; at the end of each period accountants log-
# transactions made on each account in it's ledger and consolidates all of this in a 'General Ledger
# As far as this program is concerned:
    # 1. A general ledger is useless
    # 2. Logging transactions in ledgers is made automatically with each transaction
    # as opposed to being made at the end of the period
    # this reduces the amount of work that has to be made by the user
    # the user only needs to:
        # a. Create accounts
        # b. Initiate an instance of Journaling (could be automated later on in future releases)
        # c. Record transactions with the wanted accounts
        # d. Demand any statement they want.

# WHY THE PROGRAM SEEMS ADMITTEDLY A LITTLE BIT STUPID AND CLUMSY -->
# Practically a journal entry invlves at least two aand at most three accounts
# The journal entry two equal sides called debit (henceforth--> dr) and credit (henceforth--> cr)
# whether the transaction involves two or three accounts (henceforth di, tri for simplicity)-
# Debit should always equal credit
# WHAT MAKES this program a little bit clumsy is that it has to account for both transactions that are di and tri,
# di and tri have completley different dynamics, di entries are easy, 
# but tri entries require having two account debited and one credited or one debited or two credited
# this -unless there is a way to make this more abstract- doubles the amount of code needed
# so expect to find every functionality split to account for di and tri and sometimes di, tri01 and tri02
